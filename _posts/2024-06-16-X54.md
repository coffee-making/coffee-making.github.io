## Introduction
The Mahlk√∂nig X54 X54 is a popular choice among home coffee enthusiasts, but does it live up to its promise of being an all-around grinder? In this review, we'll dive into the features and performance of this device.

**Pros and Cons**

### Adjustability and Performance
The Porta Filter holder is adjustable, allowing for customization to your brewing needs. However, when adjusted for a bottomless portafilter, it sits too high in the grinds pile-up, leading to overflow and waste. Additionally, you'll need to purge a few grams of coffee on every grind change, which can be inconvenient.

### Single-Dosing Grinder
As a single-dosing grinder, the X54 tends to withhold between 0.5-1 gram of coffee, requiring an adjustment in your brewing technique. This means you'll need to overdose your beans and weigh the output to confirm.

**Conclusion**

The Mahlk√∂nig X54 is a solid choice for home grinders, making great espresso and filter coffee with clarity, balance, and flavor. However, it's not ideal for running multiple programs simultaneously. If you're looking for an all-around grinder, this might not be the best option. [Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3Vp1Iwv)
