If you love your coffee, you've probably heard about the Ascaso line of espresso machines. And finally, the time has come to delve into the details of the Ascaso Uno!

##Introduction
For at least the last couple of years, I've had quite a few requests to review the Ascaso line of espresso machines, and for those folks, your patience is about to pay off! For those who may be unaware, Ascaso isn't brand new, and I've had their hands in espresso machines for quite some time, even producing parts for Gagia all the way back in the 1950s. But in recent years, the Spain-based company has decided to shift their focus into building a line of espresso machines, and the one we're looking at today is called the Uno.
