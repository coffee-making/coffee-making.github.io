First on our list is the Barista Blend Almond Milk from Califia Farms. This product is very popular and easy to find. Unlike unsweetened almond milk, this version has a touch of sweetness that enhances the flavor without being overwhelming. [Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3VdeE9R)


### How to Steam Almond Milk
1. **Preparation**: Shake the milk well before pouring it into your pitcher.
2. **Steaming**: Purge your steam wand. Position the pitcher slightly off-center and at a slight angle to create a good whirlpool.
3. **Air**: Add a bit more air than you would with whole milk, just a quick extra rip.
4. **Texture**: After steaming, give the pitcher a few quick taps and swirls to smooth out the texture.

### How to Pour Almond Milk
When pouring, be more gentle as almond milk is more fluid and can have a mind of its own. Control the pitcher and spout well for an even and beautiful pour.

## Oat Milk: The Industry Sweetheart

Oat milk has quickly gained popularity, especially Califia Farms' version. Its texture and taste are very close to whole milk, without that cardboard-like aftertaste some other brands have. [Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4bRLbI9)


### How to Steam Oat Milk
1. **Preparation**: Purge the steam wand and position the pitcher just like with any other milk, off-center and at an angle.
2. **Steaming**: Start slowly until a good whirlpool forms.
3. **Air**: Add a bit more air than whole milk to build texture.
4. **Rest**: Let the oat milk sit for about 30-45 seconds and give it a quick swirl for a perfect texture.

### How to Pour Oat Milk
Oat milk is quite fluid, similar to almond milk. Pour gently to maintain control and achieve flawless latte art.

## Keys to Success with Alternative Milks

### Temperature Control
Alternative milks heat up faster than whole milk due to their lower fat content. Don't burn them! Use a thermometer if necessary and stop steaming before it overheats. Burnt milk tastes awful and can ruin your coffee.

### Conclusion
Both almond and oat milk can be great for making latte art if steamed and poured correctly. Experiment and find your perfect method. Don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more coffee tips, and follow me on Instagram for contests and updates on my next videos. Stay caffeinated, pony boy!
